            The 1980s was the decade that defined modern gaming. Following the video game crash of 1983, 
            Nintendo released the <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</strong>, which revitalized 
            the home console market with hits like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This era introduced 8-bit graphics, scrolling backgrounds, and complex musical scores. 
            It also saw the birth of the "Console Wars" as Sega challenged Nintendo with the 
            Master System and later the 16-bit Genesis at the very end of the decade.
        </p>

        <p>
            Portable gaming also took a massive leap forward in 1989 with the release of the 
            <strong>Nintendo Game Boy</strong>, proving that players wanted to take their 
            adventures on the go.
